<h1>My Favorite game Grand Theft Auto 5</h1>



<p>
My favorite game is Grand Theft Auto 5 because it has a great story. You play as three characters named Franklin, Trevor, and Michael. You switch between them, completing heists, driving cars, boats, and even planes. The game has great graphics for something that came out in 2013, and it has a worldwide community of players.
</p> 
<p>
The game is playable on PS3, PS4, PS5, PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, and Xbox One there are probably more I don’t remember. It was created by Rockstar Games, one of the best game development companies in the world.
</p>

<p>It also has an online mode where players can complete missions together,
     which is really fun! I love this game because it offers a truly wonderful and enjoyable experience.
      The story mode takes about 100 hours if you take it slow and don’t speedrun.</p>

<p>
Trust me, if you haven’t played this game yet, you should try it—GTA 6 is coming out soon!
